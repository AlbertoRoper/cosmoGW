def smoothed_bPL(k, A=1, a=a_ref, b=b_ref, alp=alp_ref, norm=True, kpeak=1, Omega=False):
    
    """
    Function that returns the value of the smoothed broken power law (bPL) model
    for a spectrum of the form:
    
        zeta(K) = (b + abs(a))^(1/alp) K^a/[ b + c K^(alp(a + b)) ]^(1/alp),
        
    where K = k/kpeak, c = 1 if a = 0 or c = abs(a) otherwise. This spectrum is defined
    such that kpeak is the correct position of the peak and its maximum amplitude is given
    by A.
    
    If norm is set to Fale, then the non-normalized spectrum is used:

    Arguments:

        A -- amplitude of the spectrum

        b -- slope of the spectrum at high wave numbers, k^(-b)
        alp -- smoothness of the transition from one power law to the other
        norm -- option to normalize the spectrum such that its peak is located at
                kpeak and its maximum value is A
        kpeak -- spectral peak, i.e., position of the break from k^a to k^(-b)
